## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

To get started, you'll need to clone this repository using RStudio as a version-controlled project. Here are the steps:

1. **Install R and RStudio**: If you haven't already, make sure you have R and RStudio installed on your machine. You can download them from the following links:
   - R: [Download R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)
   - RStudio: [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

2. **Clone the Repository**:

   - Open RStudio.
   - Click on "File" in the top menu.
   - Select "New Project..."
   - Choose "Version Control" and then "Git".
   - In the "Repository URL" field, enter the URL of this repository.
   - Choose a directory where you want to create your project.
   - Click "Create Project".

   RStudio will now clone the repository and set it up as a project. You'll have the project files and environment ready for use.

### Importing Data

Once you have the project set up, you can import the necessary data. Make sure the data files are placed in a directory within the project's root directory. Here are the steps to import data into RStudio:

1. In the RStudio Files pane (usually located in the bottom right), navigate to the directory where your data is located.

2. To import data, you can use R's built-in functions or packages like `readr`, `readxl`, or any other package suitable for your data format. For example:

   ```R
   # Load the required package
   library(readr)

   # Import a CSV file named "data.csv"
   data <- read_csv("data.csv")
